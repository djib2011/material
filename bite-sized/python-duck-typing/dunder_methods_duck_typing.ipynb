        "### Other dunder methods\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial wasn't meant as a full description of python's data model and the class dunder methods; instead the goal was to show the idea of making our objects more interoperable via implementing these methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can imagine there are several other dunder methods:\n",
        "- some that make our objects work with the built in numeric opeations: `__add__` for `+`, `__sub__` for `-`, etc.\n",
        "- for string formatting, i.e. `__str__` and `__format__`.\n",
        "- for defining context managers, i.e. `__enter__` and `__exit__`.\n",
        "- for controlling instance creatinion and deletion, i.e. `__new__` and `__del__`.\n",
        "- for controlling attribute access: `__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`, etc.\n",
        "- for defining descriotors: `__get__`, `__set__`, `__del__`.\n",
        "- and many many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a full list of python dunder methods you can read [the official documetation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this tutorial was to get a glimpse of the python data model and how custom classes can be made to use the language's operators and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, we can use dataclasses to make our life a lot easier. These are special classes that essentially autogenerate the code necessary for the `__init__`, `__repr__`,  `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, and `__ge__` methods. These are best used for simple classes whose primary function is to store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Protocols and Duck Typing\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this tutorial we've seen several cases the word **protocol** appear. But what exactly is a protocol? In the context of object-oriented programming, a protocol is an **informal interface**, defined only in documentation and not in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does this mean in practice? In the `Deck` example, we mentioned that by implementing the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods our class follows the sequence protocol and thus can be used anywhere a sequence is expected in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general principle behind this is called **duck typing**. Duck typing is a programming concept that focuses on the **behavior** of an object rather than its **type**. The idea behind duck typing is inspired by the saying,\n",
        "\n",
        "> If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if an object behaves like a certain type, it is treated as an instance of that type, regardless of its actual class or type declaration. Thus in python, to make our objects interoperable with the language's built-ins, we don't need to subclass from some special type; rather we simply need to define some functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is upheld in the Python documentation, where for example certain functions will expect *a file-like object* or *an iterable* (instead of subclass of X base function).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, for some primative classes, the `isinstance` check will return true if a class fulfulls the respective protocol."
