# ML Production lab

In this lab we will focus on several concepts and technologies that help us in various aspects of dealing with ML models in production.

## Contents

1. Deploying a model as a REST API
   - Theory: 
     - What is an API?
     - What is a REST API?
     - How do I communicate with a REST API?
   - Lab:
     - FastAPI 101
     - Setting up our model's inference as an API

2. Model retraining
   - Theory:
     - Why would we want to retrain our models?
     - Explore concepts like data drift
     - What would a model training pipeline look like?
   - Lab:
     - Airflow 101
     - Setting up a model training pipeline in Airflow
